\subsection{Cate, Averill}
Averill grew up in New England, but has been living in Arizona for a couple of decades.  His undergraduate degree is in Surface Water Hydrology.  He has an MS in Water Resources and GIS, an MS in Management Information Systems and a  PhD in Geoinformatics.  He finished his graduate work exactly when the Great Recession started and consequently has been programming mostly in non-academic settings.  Over the last couple of years he has become more interested in Data Science with applications in geospatial technologies.   He is very interested in data mining for business/finance, the environment and healthcare
